I just confirmed about 101 students are yet to buy ABE 206 and SWEP logbook. Pls, kindly inform them to do that before next week CA Test. Those that didn't buy won't find the CA test easy. No amount of begging will change ANYTHING on the day of the CA test. To be forewarned is to be forearmed.

1/8/22, 4:37 PM - Lolu: *ABE206*

Good evening.

Pls re-circulate this information on the purchase of ABE 206 textbook and SWEP log book.

It is going to be an entirely different ball game on the day of the test. 

As you can see, I am always following up what is going on concerning the course. Also, I am reiterating on the textbook matter. 

Ignorance will not be accepted as a tenable excuse, therefore, it is better for all members of the class to comply.

Thanks

1/11/22, 7:31 PM - Abdulrahman Rep: You're welcome
1/11/22, 7:39 PM - +229 67 27 27 67: *Word :* Abdulrahman

*Meaning :*
The name is Arabic meaning: servant of the most gracious. True to one of the roots of the name “_Rahman_” you will find that those with the name of Abdulrahman are extremely gracious. They are kind, _courteous_, benevolent, and generous people. Being compassionate, and caring, is in the forefront of the mind of an Abdulrahman. Anyone who comes in contact with an Abdulrahman will find themselves to be content and comfortable. An Abdulrahman will _go to great lengths_ to ensure his family and friends are cared for. An Abdulrahman is a very unselfish person in life, and in the bedroom, wanting to ensure his spouse is happy and satisfied. Although very witty and funny, an Abdulrahman does not feel the need to be the life of the party. He enjoys meeting new people but those most special to him will always be his family. To win the heart of an Abdulrahman you must be an intellectual person; as he admires _the will to_ learn and appreciates those who gain insight from history.

*Example:*
I _met_ an _extremely_ _kind_ man named Abdulrahman.

That is so Abdulrahman of you.

Congress meeting happening today at LT4 by 4pm

*Please don’t miss out for anything, be there✅*
1/12/22, 1:34 PM - John 3:16: I was in my room last night when my neighbour
started screaming... "Help! Help! Snake ooo! "😳😳🙆

I ran to her room with a strong wood in my hand.
When I dashed into her room, I saw a very big snake facing my neighbour inside her
sitting room and other neighbours joined me with their heavy sticks.

We all started shouting, "Today is the end of your life, you evil snake!". I wanted to be a hero that night, so I first of all ran to the snake to hit it with my wood. It turned and faced us with red
eyes. Then, I said if I count 1 to 3, we should hit the snake at once which we all agreed. I started counting, 1...2....3 go! Then, Peeeeeeeem! NEPA seized the light and deep darkness covered the room.😂

Omo come and see stamped in the room,😂 the worst part was that non of us remembered where the door was located. My neighbors and I were just jumping haphazardly like reggae dancers on stage because we didn't know whether the snake was close by. Some people climbed chairs while some climbed the center table. Me I found myself on top of the fridge. We were just hitting one another with our sticks thinking it was the snake!😂 If somebody mistakenly touch another person a heavy wood will hit the person with immediate alacrity.😂😂😂

As I was standing on the fridge, few seconds later something soft touched my ankle!😂 Omo I didn't waste time in hitting the thing with my big stick! Immediately I heard cry in the room😂 Somebody was shouting "Jesus! My head oo! Who hit me?" It was then I realized that I had hit a human being.😂 I moved blindly forward to console the person then I mistakenly fell from the fridge and my hand touched something that looked like somebody's kneel! Almost immediately a heavy wood landed on my hand😂 I shouted "Blood of God who hit me" Papa Emeka shouted "Jesus Jerry no vex na me, I think say na the snake touch me.😂😂😂

Few seconds later Nepa restored power supply and everywhere became bright again. I looked up and saw papa David hanging on the ceiling fan.😂😂😂

To cut the story short,
we were able to k ill the snake, but everyone left the room quietly with swollen body parts! 😂😂

Did I put smile on your face ?? Cause Dem don batter my own face with iron rod 😑..

🔥🔥🔥 *Creation of ABE PQ*🔥🔥🔥

_Good morning to us all_ 🌅
_We are well aware, there is no sure banker PQ available for ABE 206.All past questions going around were created by students trying to help out._

*_As we are going to write our test, let each of us note down at least 3 questions and drop it in our respective departmental groups._*

_This will help us create something we can work with for the exam_

May God help us all🙏🏾

1/13/22, 1:04 PM - Edward Rep: *IT IS MY UNYIELDING COMMITMENT TO SERVE THE STUDENTS OF THE BETTER BY FAR UNIVERSITY. IT IS MY OBJECTIVE DECISION TO SUBMIT MYSELF TO THE SERVICE OF OTHERS.*


Let me begin by taking a sip from the cup of wisdom of *Mahatma Gandi* when he said  “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” (Mahatma Gandhi)

Fellow *UNILORITEs*, in the last two years, the world witnessed unprecedented changes which affected both our private and our social lives. Economies all over the world were negatively impacted while academics was a monumental victim. Due to the dreadful pandemic otherwise known as COVID 19, What was known as a stable calendar stumbled, research was disrupted, courses that ought to be four years became five and those which ought to be five years became six.  Academic convocations which we often celebrated with enormous joy and funfair amidst friends and family were celebrated almost like a burial. In some places, there was no celebration at all.

However, as our great citadel of learning (The University of Ilorin) and all others across the world has now decided to charge forward, what is ahead of us is more critical than what is behind us. Fellow UNILORITEs, our union has never passionately yearned for a more vibrant, visionary, and purposeful leadership like this before. This is the time for us to put the right peg in the right hole. 

Dearest colleagues, it is on this note that I declare my intention to run for the office of the *STUDENTS' UNION PRESIDENT*, University of Ilorin. 

I must say that personal ambition does not drive me in this regard. It is my unyielding commitment to serve the students of the better by far university. It is my objective decision to submit myself to the service of others. 

While I consider this declaration as an honor for me, I hereby call upon you my brothers and my sisters, family and associates to join me in this quest. From the faculty of *ARTS* to the faculty of *AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES*, to the faculty of *LAW* and *SOCIAL SCIENCES*. From faculty of *ENGINEERING* to the faculty of *EDUCATION*. From the faculty of *LIFE SCIENCES* to the faculty of *PHYSICAL SCIENCES*. From the faculty of *PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES* to the faculty of *VETERINARY MEDICINE*. From faculty of *BASIC MEDICAL SCIENCES* to *CLINICAL SCIENCES*. From the faculty of *MANAGEMENT SCIENCES* to the faculty of *COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SCIENCES* as well as the faculty of *ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES*. 

As I embark on this journey, I know how tedious it could be. Therefore I humbly seek for your love, I humbly seek for your support. In return, I promise to give you a vibrant and all-inclusive union. I promise to give you a charismatic representation. 

Fellow UNILORITES, to achieve this, I present to you the *FTB DREAMS*, *THE FAJI TOBILOBA DREAM*. This dream is one of inclusiveness, one of united activism, and active participation. The *FTB Dream* has embedded genuine altruism, with an unselfish regard for the all-round welfare of all Unilorites. The FTB DREAM COMES with the understanding that one is not defined by identity, but by ability, sympathy, connection, and solidarity. The FTB dream is a full package coming with enhanced welfarism for students and a mechanism to protect the dignity and privileges of the students of the better by far university. 

   
As a Union saddled with the responsibility of serving the interests of Unilorites, I believe it is imperative to consolidate the efforts and achievements of our predecessors particularly in the areas of transportation, security, sports, entertainment, health care, digitalization, intellectual capacity, and welfare packages.

The essential need to these are some of the realities we are going to face in the year ahead, and it is in full consciousness and recognition of these that I am presenting myself to be given an opportunity to serve and to lead a team that will provide solutions to our common problems. 

If I am elected, I will adhere strictly to the rules and regulations as enshrined in the students’ union constitution and the university codes of conduct in the pursuit of our cardinal programs which will be outlined in our manifesto and spelt out in our policy papers.

With all sense of humility and purpose, I appeal to all Unilorites irrespective of the differences in sex, religion, ethnicity, origin, political affiliations, faculty, and departments, to join hands with us in the work to inclusively develop our union and improve our general welfare as students. 

Lastly dearest colleagues, a popular African proverb goes thus; 'If you want to go fast, go alone but if you want to go far, then go together. It is on this note that I appeal to you to walk with me on this journey.  As Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia had said in the battle of Adowa against the Italians "Those who are strong, please give me your strength, those who are weak, please help me with prayer". Today I *FAJI TOBILOBA* seek for your strength and I seek for your prayer. 

Once again, my name is FAJI TOBILOBA, an aspiring candidate for the office of the student union President, University of Ilorin. Thank you for your time. Interesting moment lies ahead. 


Long live Students’ Union!
Long live the University of Ilorin!
Long live Nigeria. 
Thank you.

1/16/22, 1:35 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Torr....
No be fight...
Truth is, no matter how you present this, no mentally stable person will logically cram maths, they always know it....
If I'll advise anyone, it will be to know this thing in depth.... That's what I'm studying currently and I've realised one can easily pass the course when its fully understood...
Its not like the man wrote stories to cram na... He gave methods, if one knows the methods he gave, you're good to go
1/16/22, 1:36 PM - Aisha: <Media omitted>
1/16/22, 1:36 PM - Aisha: Yup
Exactly
His method😁
1/16/22, 1:37 PM - +234 901 890 7307: Or we go just dey write am till we tire?
1/16/22, 1:38 PM - Kingsley: I’m not sure
But I advise we do up to 7
1/16/22, 1:38 PM - Kingsley: She only suggested cramming if you don’t know your way around the methods🙂
1/16/22, 1:39 PM - Lolu: <Media omitted>

1/16/22, 1:39 PM - Kingsley: <Media omitted>
1/16/22, 1:39 PM - Aisha: Wo Judith I don't know
Me I never read that topic 🥲😒
He should give us though... cause he once gave a classwork and he told us where to stop
1/16/22, 1:40 PM - Kingsley: I understand we are all agitated rn
Mixing up each other’s words is inevitable…

I get your point chief😃

*DECLARATION OF INTENT*
Good Day Nuesaites,

I am DINA PEACE popularly known as *PEACE*, a 200level student of the Department of Computer Engineering. After serious and deep thinking, consideration, consultations and planning, I hereby formally declare my intent to serve as the next Assistant General Secretary of our great association, NUESA for the 2021/2022 ACADEMIC SESSION.

As Vince Lombardi said,
"The quality of a person's life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor."

"Individual commitment to a group effort—that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work."

"I will demand a commitment to excellence and to victory, and that is what life is all about."

 Great Nuesaites, I present myself to you for humble, effective and productive service to our prestigious association.

Furthermore, it is often said that leadership is the ability to birth results. Dearest NUESITES, I am ready to birth the results we all need. 

*VOTE PEACE AS NUESA AGS💫*

It's a great privilege and honour of my life to present myself to serve you as the President of the Students Union of the better by the far university.

Quintessential Unilorites, I would like to extend my profound appreciation for your massive show of love and support all through this journey- at the manifestos, rallies, and the just-concluded press night which saw the energetic presence and participation of progress-minded students all through the night.

*CAMPAIGN BAN*

As contained in the UISEC elections schedule, all forms of campaign and canvassing are to stop tonight 18th of January, 11:59 pm. We, therefore, implore the entire student populace to comply with these guidelines and take down all forms of campaign across all media channels. 

The Faji Tobiloba campaign team, therefore dissociate itself completely from all forms of campaign on physical and digital spaces. 

*PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE*

To reaffirm our resolve towards an all inclusive development for the union, we call on all unilorites to come en mass, to participate in the 7th Sense Presidential and vice-presidential debates coming up tomorrow, 12pm at the university auditorium.
Let's do this together once again.

Dear Orange Tag Family,

The nexus between Engineering and creating history is irrefutable. Technology is borne out of innovation - making the seemingly impossible to be - and having the guts to actualize it. 
It is on this note that I, *Ikpokonte Esuuk* aka *MzPeace* a 400 level student of the Department of Water Resources and Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology humbly declare my intention to be the next President of this prestigious Faculty. 

Having served in various capacities and representing the faculty honorably, with track records of achievements and successes, I intend to fly higher the flag of excellence attached to the orange tag and bring forth an era of innovation to the Orange taggites, while serving you dedicatedly and to the best of my ability. 
It'll be ground breaking to make history together with you, to serve you, and to make Faculty of Engineering and Technology stand tall as always!
I hereby humbly solicit your support to actualize this dream! 
*_Choose competency, innovativeness and deliverabilty._*

1/19/22, 7:44 AM - Abdulrahman Rep: Great Engineering students! 

Yes, it's that time of the session again where there are rallies and campaigns, where we see banners and posters at every corner of the school, where prospective candidates come to vie for our supports in the elections.

And you might just ignore them but no! Let's not do that. As proud NUESAITES, our participation in this forthcoming faculty elections is crucial because it gives us an opportunity to make decisions that will affect the faculty as a whole.

It gives us a unique opportunity to select the right candidates that will represent the whole faculty of Engineering and its ideas and also bring about the changes we seek both at our faculty and at the university.

*Voting for leaders that will support the interest of all Engineering students is the right decision.*

*Make the right decision on election day!*
*Every vote counts!*

Please all campaigning activities will be banned tonight so please, all the campaign flags, banners and stickers should be taken down. 
As of now, I dissociate from all campaign-related activities both physically and virtually.

Let's now shift our focus to the main elections and ensure that we actively participate, vote and mobilize others to do same.
Thank you

1/20/22, 8:07 PM - +234 816 443 2552: 0.0 or 0.000001
1/20/22, 8:13 PM - +234 909 734 3672: Me self it confused me

1/20/22, 8:14 PM - +234 813 828 3474: 0.000001✅
1/20/22, 8:17 PM - +234 909 734 3672: Abeg who knows whether we are to convert our values to MPa or not
1/20/22, 8:17 PM - +234 909 734 3672: Guy na places of decimal be this I think
1/20/22, 8:21 PM - Kenny: We are! It was explicitly stated with the questions
1/20/22, 8:22 PM - Akeem: So the value we get at first is in which unit?
1/20/22, 8:22 PM - +234 813 828 3474: The zeros you have before the initial answer have no effect after conversion.
1/20/22, 8:23 PM - +234 813 828 3474: Newton per metre sq.
1/20/22, 8:23 PM - Akeem: Ok thanks boss
1/20/22, 8:24 PM - Kenny: I think the man meant 2 significant figures rather than 2 decimal places
1/20/22, 8:30 PM - +234 813 828 3474: Exactly the point

1/20/22, 8:46 PM - Kenny: Is there another way of representing the information in 2dp?
1/20/22, 8:46 PM - Kingsley: Don’t think oo
Let’s be specific
1/20/22, 8:46 PM - John 3:16: Amen ooo😂😂😅
1/20/22, 8:48 PM - Kenny: Yeah, I don't think submitting it as 0.00 MPa is the right method, since the answer can be something like 12 Pa.
1/20/22, 8:49 PM - Kingsley: That means we have to contact him on that
1/20/22, 8:49 PM - Kingsley: It’s not logical submit 0.00Mpa
1/20/22, 8:49 PM - +234 816 456 6201: We went to meet him...
Baba chased us and said we didn't attend this morning's class that's why we don't know what to do
1/20/22, 8:50 PM - Kingsley: Ahh
What is this ment tori oloun
1/20/22, 8:50 PM - Kingsley: Who attended abeg?
1/20/22, 8:51 PM - +234 813 159 5233: The thing wey me I heard in the class was dat we fit use up to 10 d.p
1/20/22, 8:51 PM - +234 816 456 6201: So I later heard he said we should submit the full answer...
But he will most probably re-program his answer
1/20/22, 8:51 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Yeah... This....
1/20/22, 8:51 PM - +234 816 443 2552: It’s a place of decimal so for example we would give 0.00001 instead of 0.000012 I think
1/20/22, 8:51 PM - +234 816 456 6201: His portal bla bla bla sha....
Just submit the answer fully...
1/20/22, 8:51 PM - Kingsley: Okay 
Sensible
But it doesn’t cost him anything to re-edit his form
1/20/22, 8:52 PM - Kingsley: Okay better
1/20/22, 8:52 PM - Augustine: <Media omitted>
1/20/22, 8:52 PM - Kingsley: Full answer it is then
1/20/22, 8:53 PM - raqib: So the unit would be Mpa ??
1/20/22, 8:52 PM - John 3:16: Hmmmm

1/20/22, 8:53 PM - +234 810 828 0827: Abeg make person drop example of d full answer
1/20/22, 8:54 PM - +234 901 890 7307: Oh okay okay
1/20/22, 8:54 PM - Kenny: Oh, well, it's a function of perception
1/20/22, 8:54 PM - Augustine: <Media omitted>
1/20/22, 8:55 PM - Kingsley: Nop
The full answer in the number of decimal places you have then in Mpa
1/20/22, 8:55 PM - Kingsley: Yeah

1/21/22, 5:39 PM - +234 703 585 0700: *THE BIRTH OF THE FAJI TOBILOBA DREAM AND THE INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA!!!*

Praise be to God, from whom all blessings flow. 

Distinguished Unilorites, With heart filled with gratitude; bearing in mind the responsibility ahead of us; the sacrifices of our predecessors in laying the foundation of our constructive Unionism; I thank you for believing in me and entrusting me with your mandate to become the 35th President Elect of the Students’ Union, University of Ilorin. Also, I thank the Management of our prestigious University, in no order, for their continuos and assiduous efforts in creating an enabling environment for our students to thrive in their academics and career pursuits.

Dearest colleagues, I want to reaffirm you of my unflinching commitment to the *Inclusive development agenda*: Welfare, social, academic and career prosperity and advancement of our students irrespective of background or diversity will be prioritized and any attempt to jeopardize this will be countered objectively and decisively. To further buttress the open door policy we promised; the doors at the KADUNA NZEOGWU building shall not be a barrier but a cosmetics display. All students shall have access to the Union officials and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of our Union. 

Greatest Unilorites, If there is anyone out there who still doubts that University of Ilorin is a place that gives every dream equal chance to thrive; who still questions the power of our democracy, yesterday was your answer. It was the answer told by thousands of Unilorites - who despite their bustling schedule dedicated time to exercise their political franchise. It was the answer demonstrated by the electoral body in ensuring the code and conduct of the commission as enshrined in the students’ union compendium are adhered to. It was the answer given by the school management, most especially, the student affairs unit in ensuring the election process are not corrupted and bastardized.

This victory was not without it’s own rigour neither was It a product of just happenstances. Every piece was masterfully planned and executed by people who believed in me even more than I do. I appear taller and see farther because I stand on the shoulders of giants. On this note, I want to appreciate my Leaders Comrade *Oyedeji AbdulAfeez Experience,  Adebisi Uthman Unity, Comrade Olabode Stephen Opeyemi (O'smart)* for the meaningful guidance and Immense support in bringing the shared aspiration to fruition. 

To my Outstanding team, my brothers and leaders across faculties who sacrificed dearly; ambitions, time, relationships and resources for the Sucess of this struggle, most especially distinguished *Senator Premier of the Faculty of CIS and Sen Badmus of Engineering* for their selflessness.This victory is dedicated to you all. Also, to my co-contestant; friends, brothers and a daring lady who contested with me, you are all wonderful. You pushed me to learn more, work more and be more. I want to assure you I am open to collaborations and patnership. Initiatives that can better improve the *Inclusive Development agenda* will always be welcomed.

Upon inauguration as the 35th president of Student Union. I will be building on the legacy of the *People-focused administration* ably led by my personal President, *Comrade Toafiq Waliyullah popularly addressed as OMOLUABI* and bringing more innovations for the prosperity and advancement of the Union and our students. If I have shortcomings, we are not afraid to have them pointed out and criticized, because we serve the people. Anyone, no matter who, may point out our shortcomings. If he is right, we will correct them. If what he proposes will benefit the people, we will act upon it. I hereby seek the support of God Almighty and students of University of ILORIN. I wish you best of luck in you examinations, academic and career pursuit.

I, Shittu Oluwafunmilayo Elizabeth would like to use this medium to air a disclaimer on a campaign broadcast that has been going around with my name on it.
I seclude myself from these broadcasts and I want to make it clear that I and my team don’t have anything to do with campaigning, as we are all very aware of the ban  which was put in place as from 11:59pm on the 19th of January, 2022.

Thanks for understanding.

            *NOTIFICATION ON ELECTION*


The Commission, in a bid to deliver a free, fair, credible and praiseworthy election as NUESites expects us to hereby announce a reopening of the registration portal on the NUESA Website.

This move was made because of the different requests gotten from different quarters in the faculty that some students weren't able to register.
In light of the above, we hereby announce that students can register from 6:20pm to 6:30pm, following the modalities for registration.
Furthermore, the time for voting has been extended from 6:30pm till 7:00pm.

All agents are expected to be at LTIII for the announcement of results as soon as voting ends.

Thank you.

Good morning 
I wish everyone good luck in today’s exam.
Piece of advice; Abeg try chop something. You will need it. The strength I mean. It will come in handy when the time comes. 
And if you plan to faint upon seeing the question like I don plan am…abeg no chop, so e no go be only me wey go faint. Hehe…don’t mind me

Good luck once again.✌🏽💪🏽

In a bid to help 100 level students with drawing materials, I humbly request for your drawing materials that won't be useful to you again

Make sure you don't dull, be as fast as possible, try your best, the last thing you did on your paper might give you 1 mark that will save you. Make good use of today and avoid repeating.

Those of you that knows, don't be stingy. You wouldn't be happy seeing your mate carrying over.

Good luck guys.

Good afternoon everyone.

If I say I didn't know what you guys went through concerning this *Engr. K.O Exam*, it is a pure lie.

I've been there before and I know how it feels.

You've tried your effort, you did night class all through without sleeping, using Energy Drink to hold body.

I pray this is the last time you all carry this board around.
And I pray to Almighty God to bless your effort and grant/bless you all with good grades.

Keep it up, keep being strong, we still have a long way to go.

From;
Bello (Professor)

_2020/2021 ACADEMIC SESSION_

*PRESS RELEASE*

05:58pm

*CONSTRUCTION OF PS - NEW COHS ROAD AND INSTALLATION OF STREET LIGHTS*

After consistent and concerted efforts of the leadership of the Union, we are glad to announce that the University through Federal Government Intervention has began the rehabilitation and expansion of about 2km road linking PS and New COHS.

The Management has also began the overhaul repair and installation of new Street lights across our campus. Places that have been illuminated so far are S.U.B./private hostels, Works/Pharmacy road, the road to new Environmental Science building and private hostel road.

Recall that the leadership of the Union in various meetings with the University management has raised these issues as trivial issues affecting the wellbeing of Unilorites. We hereby appreciate the University Management ably led by the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Sulyman Abdulkareem Age for fulfilling his promises.

Be assured that the road linking New COHS and UITH is also going to be fixed as the contract have been awarded and is expected to commence soon.

We are also using this medium to advise members of the University community to desist from vandalization of the street lights and overspeeding.

1/31/22, 7:51 PM - +234 901 890 7307: My  Dear Students 

*Second Semester* 
*Second Week of Exam Begins today, January 31. 2022*

*"1. Punctuality"*
Get to examination venue an hour to the commencement. Stop attitude of reading to the exam hall. 

*"2. Bags, Phone, Etc"*
Dont get to exam venue with your bag, phone, digital watch, etc. Obey school regulations  pls. It is part of good character. My office is always accessible to keep your bag.

*"3. School Programs"*
Examination not an excuse to shun such programs. Last week some of your colleagues attended inaugural lecture, the first to be delivered by an ASUU chairman.

TOPIC: The belly, the brain environmental toxins. Balancing the conflicts between necessity and cost

*"4. Newspaper"*
Have you read the Guardian? Or BBC today? Last week? 

*OG*

2/1/22, 11:04 AM - +234 816 443 2552: You want me to aspire to respire?
2/1/22, 11:05 AM - Tosin: For the contribution it was just the sales- (labour costs +purchase which are variables costs o guess) but in the pq it will be sales minus variable costs
2/1/22, 11:05 AM - Tosin: Then for the margin what you get from this divided by total sales *100
2/1/22, 11:05 AM - +234 901 890 7307: <Media omitted>
2/1/22, 11:05 AM - Tosin: Then the rest below the variable are fixed costs

2/1/22, 11:06 AM - Lolu: Send vn explaining abeg
2/1/22, 11:06 AM - Tosin: They used just variable cost
2/1/22, 11:06 AM - Tosin: So you would just subtract the variable cost from the sales
2/1/22, 11:06 AM - Tosin: <Media omitted>
2/1/22, 11:06 AM - +234 901 890 7307: Okay okay

2/1/22, 11:07 AM - +234 901 890 7307: 👍🏽thanks
2/1/22, 11:07 AM - Tosin: This one is for break even it will be the fixed cost / contribution margin
2/1/22, 11:07 AM - Tosin: The fixed cost should be everything below the variable cost
2/1/22, 11:07 AM - Tosin: E go worse 😂😂

A refrigeration unit is cooling a space to -5°C by rejecting energy to the atmosphere at 20°C.
It is desired to reduce the temperature in the refrigerated space to -25°C. Calculate the 
minimum percentage increase in work required, by assuming a Carnot refrigerator, for the same 
amount of energy removed.

 *Ans : 94%* 

Question 2


The food compartment of a refrigerator is maintained at 4°C by removing heat from it at a rate 
of 360 kJ/min. If the required power input to the refrigerator is 2 kW, determine (a) the 
coefficient of performance of the refrigerator and (b) the rate of heat rejection to the room that 
houses the refrigerator.

a. *Ans = 3* 

b. *Ans= 8kW* 



Question 3

P
A heat pump is used to meet the heating requirements of a house and maintain it at 20°C. On a 
day when the outdoor air temperature drops to -2°C, the house is estimated to lose heat at a rate 
of 80,000 kJ/h. If the heat pump under these conditions has a COP of 2.5, determine (a) the 
power consumed by the heat pump and (b) the rate at which heat is absorbed from the cold 
outdoor air.

a. *Ans: 32,000 kJ/hr* 
b. *Ans: 48,000 kJ/hr* 


Cop of refrigerator = Qc/wᵢₙ= Qc/(Qh-Qc) = 1/(Qh/Qc)-1

Cop of Heat pump = Qh/wᵢₙ= Qh/(Qh-Qc) = 1/1- (Qc/Qh)

wᵢₙ= work input 
Qh= quantity of heat rejected 
Qc= quantity of heat absorbed

1. A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data.

2. A computer includes both hardware and software.

3. Hardware is the physical aspect of the computer that can be touched.

4. Computer programs, known as software, are the invisible instructions that control the
hardware and make it perform tasks.

5. Computer programming is the writing of instructions (i.e., code) for computers to
perform. 

6. The central processing unit (CPU) is a computer’s brain. It retrieves instructions
from memory and executes them.

7. Computers use zeros and ones because digital devices have two stable electrical
states, off and on, referred to by convention as zero and one.

8. A bit is a binary digit 0 or 1.

9. A byte is a sequence of 8 bits.

10. A kilobyte is about 1,000 bytes, a megabyte about 1 million bytes, a gigabyte about
1 billion bytes, and a terabyte about 1,000 gigabytes.


11. Memory stores data and program instructions for the CPU to execute.

12. A memory unit is an ordered sequence of bytes.

13. Memory is volatile, because information that hasn’t been saved is lost when the
power is turned off.

14. Programs and data are permanently stored on storage devices and are moved to
memory when the computer actually uses them.

15. The machine language is a set of primitive instructions built into every computer.


16. Assembly language is a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is
used to represent each machine-language instruction.

17. High-level languages are English-like and easy to learn and program.

18. A program written in a high-level language is called source code.

19. A compiler is a software program that translates the source program into a machine-language program.

20. The operating system (OS) is a program that manages and controls a computer’s
activities

21. You can run Python on Windows, UNIX, and Mac.

22. Python is interpreted, meaning that Python translates each statement and processes it
one at a time.

23. You can enter Python statements interactively from the Python statement prompt >>>or store all your code in one file and execute it using one command.

24. To run a Python source file from the command line, use the python filename.py
command
2/6/22, 4:01 AM - Aisha: A character is stored in a
computer as a sequence of 0s and 1s. 

Mapping a character to its binary representation is called
character encoding. 

There are different ways to encode a character.

 The manner in which
characters are encoded is defined by an encoding scheme. 


One popular standard is ASCII
(American Standard Code for Information Interchange), a 7-bit encoding scheme for representing all uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters.

ASCII uses numbers 0 through 127
2/6/22, 4:01 AM - Aisha: + Addition 
- Subtraction 
* Multiplication 
/ Float Division 1 / 2 =  0.5
// Integer Division 1 // 2 =  0
** Exponentiation 4 ** 2 =  16
% Remainder 20 % 3 = 2 this takes the remainder after dividing..


+= , Addition assignment  i += 8, means  i = i + 8
-=,  Subtraction assignment i -= 8 , means i = i - 8
*= Multiplication assignment.  i *= 8, means  i = i * 8

 //= Integer division assignment i //= 8, means  i = i // 8


%= Remainder assignment i %= 8 , means i = i % 8
**= Exponent assignment i **= 8 , means i = i ** 8



For all these , you'd definitely arrive at a new value of I...

2/6/22, 4:01 AM - Aisha: Python also supports Unicode.

 Unicode is an encoding scheme for representing international characters.

 ASCII is a small subset of Unicode.

 Unicode was established by theUnicode Consortium to support the interchange, processing, and display of written texts
in the world’s diverse languages.

 A Unicode starts with \u, followed by four hexadecimal
digits that run from \u0000 to \uFFFF


The ASCII code for (a) is 97, which is greater than the code for A (65). 

The ASCII code for
lowercase letters are consecutive integers starting from the code for a, then for b, c, and so on,
up to the letter z. 

The same is true for the uppercase letters. 


The difference between the ASCIIcode of any lowercase letter and its corresponding uppercase letter is the same: 32.

 This is a
useful property for processing characters
2/6/22, 4:01 AM - Aisha: For 'A' it's 65, 'B' its 66, 'C' its 67 all the way to 'Z' - 90

a - 97, b -98, c - 99 all the way to z - 122

2/6/22, 7:02 PM - Abdulmalik: Post increment operator, 

The right hand side of the equality operator gets performed first, before the value get incremented

So first 5*5 then value of I incremented twice (for each I++)

Also the man corrected it, it's all capital I, not small letter i
2/6/22, 7:02 PM - ViNe 69: 🙇‍♂️
2/6/22, 7:03 PM - Abdulmalik: Not necessarily in superscript form, and it means adding 1 to value of variable

Just that it's either post increment or pre increment and kinda confusing
2/6/22, 7:24 PM - +234 903 935 4392: Boss abeg can u reexplain this thoroughly, cus ano understand how I++ mean square pawer and also mean +1+1, like how do u understand which one is square and which is +1+1
2/6/22, 7:32 PM - Abdulmalik: Here @2349039354392 

the question
I = I++ * I++ 

Our initial value of I is 5, so I * I  is 25. Then for each I++ In the expression above, the value of I is increased by 1

1. *He said programming is rational thinking, any rational thinker won't have any problem in the exam.* 

2. *He said your thinking ability of what programming is all about, is what you're going to be tested on (whether is python or what Engr Oniyide has taught you), and For you to pass this exam you need to think like a programmer* 

 *3. You should not be intimidated by volume of the material your mates are sending out.* 

4. *He said he trust that you're going to smile tomorrow, but the only thing that may not make you smile is that maybe the number of the questions against the time, and that is what they have not decided on, but outside that whether it's python question, think, whether it's GW basic, think, whether it's the concept of programming, think, if you're able to do that you will pass.*

2/11/22, 2:56 AM - +234 703 585 0700: Reminder:
1. The course is very simple shouldn’t be a reason why you shouldn’t read it but a reason why you must have A

2. The course has a sure PQ shouldn’t be reason why you shouldn’t read the material, the PQ should just be an assistance or alternative 

3. It’s my last course shouldn’t be a reason why you should be relaxed, you have never stopped so why stop now??

2/15/22, 7:15 PM - Abdulrahman Rep: *UPDATE!*

*STUDENT WORK EXPERIENCE PROGRAM (SWEP)*
_15 February 2022._

Good afternoon, distinguished colleagues.

Trust y'all are good.

To a very large extent, we understand the advent of the strike has been a major discussion in recent times, especially amongst 200Level Engineering students who have the compulsory Student Work Experience Program (SWEP) (3rd semester) to tend to. We're sorry for the inconvenience.

In a bid to understand the situation of things and the chances of having the SWEP program, even during the Industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, we interacted with the SWEP coordinator and he emphasised the need for us to exercise patience while he attends to issues surrounding the strike action and the program. However, he emphatically mentioned that the program is temporally on hold and this is largely a function of the strike.

Nonetheless, as reputable class reps that we are, we'll keep engaging to obtain valid information and yes, we'll carry you along every step of the way.

We are sorry for the inconvenience this might have caused. We are all in this, together.😊

Best regards!

*UPDATE: COHS TRANSPORTATION*

As promised, the leadership of the Union met the Keke riders association in order to have a way forward on the increment of transportation fare from PS to College.

Temporarily, the following are the agreed transport fares:
PS - Old College (N150)
PS - New College (N100)
Old college - New college (N80)

Concerned students should however note that this agreement is tentative and normalcy will be restored as soon as the scarcity of fuel ends.

2/19/22, 7:18 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Help!!!
2/19/22, 7:18 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Answers 1-3 are the same with mine
2/19/22, 7:20 PM - +234 812 363 2882: But 4 I got -50WL which makes sense cause it's bending moment while he wrote: -50W which has unit of newton
2/19/22, 7:20 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Number 5 I have -325WL
2/19/22, 7:22 PM - +234 812 363 2882: I think number 4, question 3 is a mistake on his part cause all the other ones have: WL

2/19/22, 7:25 PM - +234 812 363 2882: And for number 5 how can the maximum bending moment on that cantilever be zero

2/19/22, 7:25 PM - ViNe 69: Your brain still fresh o

2/19/22, 7:26 PM - +234 812 363 2882: I think he wrote zero cause the maximum bending moment is negative(anticlockwise)
2/19/22, 7:26 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Lies
2/19/22, 7:26 PM - Aisha: Me wey never bother open am 😓

2/19/22, 7:53 PM - +234 812 363 2882: It is maximum in the anticlockwise direction that what the minus means
2/19/22, 7:58 PM - +234 701 898 6087: Oh, true,buh I calculated it to be zero actually,u can't really get the maximum point from the graph ,cos of the nature of the BMD...

2/21/22, 6:51 PM - Lanre: <Media omitted>
2/21/22, 7:22 PM - Aisha: 📌Guidlines to filling the SWEP logbook📌

*1. Do not personalise the activities* e.g

"I carried out the analysis using the
disintegration test machine and I recorded
the results obtained after analysis ". OR like
"I visited the welding and fabrication section and I was shown various tools used such as....."

Try to avoid those. A typically correct
version of the above report would be

"An analysis was carried out using the
disintegration tester machine, and the
results obtained, recorded. " and respectively like
"The welding and fabrication was visited and tools auch as this and that, was shown....."

*2. Report in past tense and not present, as the time of events will always be a past eventually* .
Imagine the following:

"I am testing the stability of the drug by
using the Frailbility tester."

Compare with;

"The stability of the drug was determined
through the use of the Frailbility tester:"

*3. "Variability is the spice of life". Your reports should not be a series of repetitive events.*
Vary the activities and ensure to avoid the use of same phrases
or clauses always.

 *Note* : If the activities of a day is too much, do not report all the activities of that day into the logbook if it can't be contained in the portion specified for the day. Rather split and preserve for
the days when you probably may not be involved in any activity.

*4. Choose powerful and right words when writing* . 
It brings your work to life and
soothes the soul of the reader.

Sample:

Monday: (Section/Department visited* could be underlined)

In the Chemical engineering section, lecture was taken on 'this and that' and various tools were shown such as.... their uses were also taught, for example uses of.... include.... and.....

"Explain events briefly"

*ILORIN AUTO ACCIDENT: CONDOLENCE MESSAGE*

We are bereaved and sad to have received the news about the sudden death of three of our colleagues who were involved in a fatal auto accident on Sunday 20th February, 2022 along Airport road, Ilorin. The unfortunate incident involved a private vehicle and a commercial bus conveying passengers to Lagos State. The bus was reported to have caught fire after a collision between the two vehicles.

Out of the five Unilorites on board, three died leaving two as survivors of the sardonic event. Due to the injuries sustained, both of them are currently receiving medical treatment at the General Hospital, Ilorin and University Teaching Hospital respectively.

On behalf of every Unilorites, we express our condolences to the friends, colleagues and family members of the deceased and we pray God in his infinite mercy comfort them and grant them the fortitude to bear the loss. We equally pray that God also grant the survivors a sound and healthy recovery.

Finally, we urge every Unilorites to stay safe as we pray not to have such occurrence in our midst anymore.

As a department ild love to plead with us to take it seriously. since we are not going in as one group to the same unit..
I just wanto suggest that after the conclusion of your own unit that one person in each unit converts his/her  concluded work to pdf format that will give us all heads up on how to prepare well before we reach the unit.*please if you see sense in this let's make it happen no man is an island*

3/4/22, 1:24 PM - Abdulrahman Rep: Welding and Fabrication 

Fabrication of a Parker 
-The side view elevation diagram
-It has two parts: the handle and the body
-the plan diagram
-When broken apart it has four pieces: the main body. 
-if it is a thin component it should be folded together and if it is a thick component it should be cut seperately. 

Before Fabrication, there should be a design
- Analyze the concept of the design: What is it meant for, what you want to use it for  ie From a simple to a complex design
- Side note: ball bearing and bush bearing, bolt and nut, housing etc. They are examples of components commonly needed in design
- The reason for the design of a Parker going from a wider area/length to a narrower one allows the parker to do things a lot more easier. Surface area/length shouldn't be maintained. 
- Make a sketch of what you want to fabricate by using freehand, then use the sketch for drawing ie the engineering drawing containing the dimensions of the material to be fabricated(in mm). Scales such as 1:20, 1:50, 1:200 etc. are used In order to accommodate for the drawing
- Side Note: Scriber is used for marking out. When drawing a scriber, the scale should remain the same because it isn't a large object. Scales should be properly utilized so that drawing is as legible as possible. 
- Dimensions should be in standard form. Conversion In inches and feet.
- Rake ratio: 48:1:Length, 1:3:Width
- Design concept affects everything concerning the design from the length, to the width to the height.

Fabrication Process
- After you have concluded on your design concept and drawn, the next thing is to mark out.  
- you pick your material and mark out your dimensions. You can use the principle of surface development of a cone to make a Parker. 
- by recreating the surface development of the parker on a material we can go ahead to weld without cutting too much. We only cut with a scriber. 
- an alternative method is to draw a cone and then cut across it, then use the pattern formed to make a Parker.

We looked at an example of a melon processing machine in the workshop
- The chuck and the cover: where the melon is thrown in and what is used to cover it. The hinges allow for opening and closing, it is a critical part. The chuck contains hammers that beat the melon into pieces
- the mini hammers beat the pulp into pieces, the pieces passes through the sieve to the outlet. Bolts and nuts, pulleys, belts, stands and all others were fabricated seperately and then put together. The product comes out thro a conveyor belt into a container. 
- the container has water and then it washes the melon pieces, the remnants and seeds are separated. The conveyor belt then carries the melon seeds to a drier and the the Temperature of the drier is operated at a point that dries but not melts the seeds. 
- after it is done and dried, it is taken to where it is broken( melon crushing machine) and taken to where it is milled and oiled and then bottled in different ways. 
- every part of the machine is fabricated one by one and then joined together to create the machine. 

Side Note: Zig zags are used to show errors in marking out.

Joints in Welding and Fabrication
1. Z Joint: Weld at the joints of the z using dimensions
2. L joint: Weld at the joint of the L using dimensions given 
3. V Joint, C Joint etc 
A motor car has various types of joints present within it. The roofing structure of a building also has joints. 

Types of Welding
Arc Welding: method of welding based off on connection with electrodes 

Oxy-acetylene gas Welding: it is a means of welding using oxygen and acetylene(a combustible gas: sparks or flames shouldn't be allowed near it). 

Gadgets include the nozzle, welding torch which has two knobs for acetylene (red) and oxygen(blue) each. It is connected to the cylinder through hoses, manufacturers label with A and O to avoid errors when fixing. Make sure it is tightened properly. 

The gauge controls the oxygen and acetylene. When you open the cylinder with your spindle key, the oxygen or acetylene goes directly to the gauge. You then set the command for what you want to use it to do eg flame cutting, welding. You turn the weld until it reads to the operation you want to perform.

You turn it on by turning it in the clockwise direction. You can differentiate the oxygen cylinder (because it is tall and painted black) from the acetylene cylinder (is short and painted maroon/red oxide.)

The acetylene knob is opened before the oxygen knob. Then gas coming out is then put on with a spark lighter. The oxygen gas then changes the state of the acetylene from carburizing to neutral to oxidizing: which are the three states of the flame in gas Welding. 

Study the process of gas Welding
- Back firing is a fault during gas Welding. It is strange sound in the nozzle. The nozzle needs to be fixed before welding continue. Sounds like a gun. Make sure to put off the acetylene and oxygen knobs. Use a nozzle cleaner (like injection). You inject the hose of the nozzle with a nozzle cleaner. The particles deposited on the nozzle is then cleaned by action of the nozzle cleaner. Failure to do things properly can lead to explosion.

- Chipping hammer removes the slack from the already welded material. If you don't weld properly, there are leakages after chipping. Shearing can alternatively be used

*Press Release*

*Date: Friday, 17th March, 2022*
*Time: 9:00pm*

             *LETTER OF APPROVAL*

The Commission is aware that the current ASUU strike means unavailability of the HOD and Level Advisors, hence getting their signatures will be difficult.

For this reason, a decision has been reached to allow for the signature of the current Departmental President, Bello Hamed, to serve as a substitute for both of the above mentioned.

Students who have purchased or intend to purchase forms are to write a letter addressed to the President of the Department, stating their intended posts. He will then approve and sign, and this signed letter should be submitted back to the Commission along with the completed form. The deadline for submission is Wednesday, 23rd March, 2022.

All concerned students should endeavour to do the needful before the above stated deadline.
Thank you.

3/27/22, 10:09 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Meanwhile, its not even talking that way, its the way you think bro!
And permit me to tell you, whether you apologise or not, if you don't change your idea of sexualizing and objectifying women, there'll be another situation where you'll be overly obsessed with a lady and will unknowingly burst out like you did tonight!
And that might be the day you'll collect!
3/27/22, 10:10 PM - Abu: @2348132739637
3/27/22, 10:10 PM - Lanre: E go actually make sense if the guy later collect 
He would learn at the end of the day
3/27/22, 10:10 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Boss, dem just force am apologize, no signs say e really understand wetin he do wey wrong!
I can assure you that!
He feels he just communicated his feelings, he doesn't know that way of thinking is bad!
3/27/22, 10:11 PM - Abu: @2349054784744
3/27/22, 10:11 PM - Kingsley: You have issues with am?
3/27/22, 10:11 PM - +234 905 478 4744: Wetin?

3/27/22, 10:18 PM - +234 706 464 1737: I think he really knows he was wrong and he was sincere with d apology,  no need to reason him matter again sir
3/27/22, 10:18 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Na just the truth, na why I feel say we no even need the apology!
Na just for him to dey think correctly! 

PS: to any other guy or guys that also sexualize women, your day will come, and they'll flog you mercilessly laslas👍🏾

3/27/22, 10:21 PM - +234 816 456 6201: well, I don't think you really understand what sexualizing women entails that's why you're saying this!

He doesn't even know fully what he did wrong...

What I'm trying to point out is men seeing women as tools for sexual satisfaction, that's wrong!
What did he mean by she go collect? 
Did he retract the statement?
3/27/22, 10:21 PM - Ini CPE: Ah😂💔
3/27/22, 10:23 PM - +234 816 456 6201: How many times do women see you and comment on your dick or whatever sexual parts you have!

But for these foolish guys its always a lady's ass or boobs...

If he had come and talked about her beauty or sth, would we be here having this conversation?
Why didn't he see beauty or smile or whatever?
Why was it that it was her "shaking thing' he could only remember? That's shows how he thinks
3/27/22, 10:24 PM - Abraham: 🤝🏾🤝🏾
3/27/22, 10:25 PM - Kingsley: Word
3/27/22, 10:25 PM - John 3:16: So what do you want him to do now??... I know what he did was wrong
3/27/22, 10:25 PM - Ini CPE: Omo🤝🏿
3/27/22, 10:25 PM - Kingsley: Our girls are actually being disrespected asf
3/27/22, 10:25 PM - Lanre: We are not meant to be the one to tell him that
3/27/22, 10:25 PM - Lanre: He should think
3/27/22, 10:26 PM - John 3:16: He said sorry na.... Even if na from his heart or not
3/27/22, 10:26 PM - +234 706 464 1737: I dnt knw ooo
3/27/22, 10:26 PM - +234 816 443 2552: He’s just trying to make him understand that he should change his way of thinking…
The apology wether he gave it or not honestly was useless 
But ayo is shedding more light on the topic a lot of people shy away from
3/27/22, 10:27 PM - John 3:16: Okay I get...
3/27/22, 10:27 PM - Kingsley: You know how many times rapists say sorry?
If na by sorry we no go dey go jail
3/27/22, 10:27 PM - Abu: You no get
3/27/22, 10:27 PM - John 3:16: Lol
3/27/22, 10:27 PM - John 3:16: So wetin you want make he do now??
3/27/22, 10:27 PM - John 3:16: What if he didn't say sorry?? 🌚🌚
3/27/22, 10:28 PM - Kingsley: It’s not against him entirely now
Ayo is just enlightening him and people like him
3/27/22, 10:28 PM - Abu: Wetin funny
3/27/22, 10:28 PM - Kingsley: John rest
You sef dey muzz me like this
Lol
I’m not surprised
3/27/22, 10:28 PM - Lanre: I swear
3/27/22, 10:28 PM - Kingsley: I swear
3/27/22, 10:28 PM - Abraham: Nooo ooo
Na here I no go gree
Nobody wants he half assed apology 
We want to know that okay he actually won't do this again
3/27/22, 10:28 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Goes to everyone, sexualizing women has gone on in-reprimanded far too long. If you think it’s normal or it’s not that big of an issue then you’re mind is seriously fucked up.
3/27/22, 10:28 PM - Abu: His thinking is disgusting Aswr
3/27/22, 10:29 PM - Kingsley: I tell you
Louder milady
3/27/22, 10:29 PM - Lanre: Be like john self no understand wetin the guy do
3/27/22, 10:29 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Exactly
3/27/22, 10:29 PM - Kingsley: Pretty whack
3/27/22, 10:30 PM - Ini CPE: Normal na why e dey ask plenty questions
3/27/22, 10:30 PM - Abraham: Doesn't matter 
Deed has already been done
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - John 3:16: What do you mean by you are not surprised
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - John 3:16: I know... And he don say sorry.... So what do u want him to do now.... That's my point
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - Abraham: The sorry is not taking back what has been said 
The main question is has the boy learnt that women are not objects 
This was somebody that was just having fun ooo hope you remember
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - Abraham: Learn
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - Lanre: Sorry doesn’t change anything
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - Abraham: Learn
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - +234 816 456 6201: If he didn't say sorry who cares?

Maybe some of you think this stuff is a joke!
Wale made mention of rapists saying sorry... Like he said, does their sorry change shit?

And let me tell you this, all rapists start by sexualizing females, both young and old
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - John 3:16: I understand the fact that Ayo is enlightening us that 1 is okay.... I think we should just close this matter
3/27/22, 10:31 PM - +229 67 27 27 67: 😂 😂
3/27/22, 10:32 PM - Lanre: And his sorry self na just make the matter end
3/27/22, 10:32 PM - Ini CPE: Pretty sure bro thinks of ass and boobs whenever he sees a lady which isn't right. There's more to this life than that and sorry cannot mend the fact that he blurted that out on the group chat which is very wrong and inappropriate 😑😑
3/27/22, 10:33 PM - +234 816 443 2552: The question you’re asking has been answered John, you’re just not listening.
3/27/22, 10:33 PM - Abraham: Nope 
We should not shy away from discussions like this cus some of us are uncomfortable with it 
Things like this must be discussed extensively so that everyone knows that there are boundaries in this life regardless of all the "cruise"
3/27/22, 10:34 PM - Ini CPE: 🤝🏿🤝🏿. This Bro Sabi hw life take be
3/27/22, 10:34 PM - John 3:16: Okay Ayo continue

3/27/22, 10:46 PM - John 3:16: Wo just rest there

3/27/22, 10:48 PM - +234 816 456 6201: One day?
Hmnnn... With these foolish guys around!
It seems like its worsening daily!

I can't even count daily experiences on how these guys sexualize and objectify women
3/27/22, 10:49 PM - Kingsley: 🤦🏾‍♂️
God abeg

3/27/22, 10:57 PM - Ini CPE: Amen. Dem need to align their thinking about women. Ask them majority of them won't marry their wives cause of them objectifying her. Just know this u can't objectify women forever and if u do it shows u don't hv better things to do with ur life then. Simple...

KADUNA NZEOGWU BUILDING
UNIVERSITY OF ILORIN
_2020/2021 ACADEMIC SESSION_

*PRESS RELEASE*

02/04/2022
11:43am

*RAMADAN MUBARAK!*

The leadership of the union felicitates with the University Muslim Community on the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. Beyond the fast, it is a time to encourage self-discipline, self-control, love, generousity, peaceful co-existence and other teachings of the Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.).

It is however pertinent that we all inculcate and practice these teachings even after the season.

As it is also a time to seek Allah's face, we therefore implore all our Muslim brothers and sisters to remember our dear nation, Nigeria in prayers.

Ramadan Mubarak! 🌙

4/9/22, 10:03 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Well...
Depends on how you think about it...

Men at 40-50 reach their prime age...

Tosin is in his twenties, if he marries a 30  years babe, she'll be 50+ or 60 by then...

Tell me a 60 years ma'am never expire from the scene
4/9/22, 10:04 PM - +234 816 456 6201: ‼️

4/9/22, 10:05 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Most probably in za oza room🙃....

And socially also...

Not from life, if that's what you're thinking
4/9/22, 10:05 PM - Kingsley: Humans are not commodity to place time of expiration on
Everyone should be allowed to move at their pace
4/9/22, 10:05 PM - Kingsley: Naaa

4/9/22, 10:07 PM - +234 812 363 2882: You can't trek a mile
4/9/22, 10:07 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Did you know women around the age gap of menopause and some experiences higher boosts of hormones?😂 
They actually tend to have higher sex drive, one that even a lot of young men can’t keep up with
4/9/22, 10:07 PM - Kingsley: More like aging

4/9/22, 10:10 PM - Kingsley: Another perspective?
4/9/22, 10:11 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Torr......

If a 34 or 30 year old man is marrying a fellow 30 year old babe, ggs to them.... They'll expire at the same time...
4/9/22, 10:11 PM - +234 812 363 2882: 🤣🤣

4/9/22, 10:12 PM - +234 816 456 6201: But for a young and vibrant 20+ years tosin... A 30+ babe will leave the scene before he will, which is obviously a disadvantage
4/9/22, 10:12 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Na Leonardo de caprio style sure pass
4/9/22, 10:12 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Cos men are still active till maybe 80 as the case may be
4/9/22, 10:13 PM - +234 816 456 6201: And this....

All these generals wives and senators and co you think they can hang out in Allen avenue and someone will pimp out boys to them?

Baba often boasts of shagging about 150 ladies per year..... 
And this man is not lying.... At least he stayed in the hostel for some time... This man practically takes on different women per moment, one in the morning, another in the afternoon, Christians and Muslims, atheists sef, yellow and black, fine and ugly.... Literarily any female he sees and steels  like running...
Meanwhile he was in his 40s then....  Baba ran both young and old

crown upon their foreheads. Bless them in their work and in
their companionship; in their sleeping and in their waking; in
their joys and in their sorrows; in their life and in their death.

Do you think the beating culture is toxic parenting?👀
4/24/22, 8:30 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Open question btw
4/24/22, 8:32 PM - +229 67 27 27 67: Depends on how they were raised. I believe parents that were excessively beaten by their own parents in their childhood are likely to trun their child into a boxing bag
4/24/22, 8:34 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Philippine movies...

I actually thought someone exchanged me with another child in the hospital😂
4/24/22, 8:35 PM - +229 67 27 27 67: I had classmate who hardly smiled and the day I discovered the means of scolding her dad used on her, I knew It was a living hell in their house. The man was literally punching the girl as if she was a guy.
4/24/22, 8:41 PM - +229 67 27 27 67: Let me not get started with the younger brother who was also in my class. This boy was only happy during school hours and when the closing rang it was as though he never laughed in life. One day I was "opportuned" to see the wonders the father was doing in this boy's life at every single mistakes. Literal Life threats.
That "fatefull" day the man was beating the boy, hitting him against the class walls and dragging the child on the floor in front of the whole school. No one could save this boy not even the school's principal.
4/24/22, 8:41 PM - +229 67 27 27 67: <Media omitted>
4/24/22, 8:42 PM - +234 816 456 6201: Excessive beating without the reason for being beaten is definitely toxic... 
Meanwhile, occasional corrective slaps to reset a child's brain is not too bad! Even occasional throwing of remotes, spoons and once in a while canning with an appropriate material would suffice if a *child* is doing anyhow.  Those slaps are necessary when a child is doing some how somehow. But stuffs like beating a child due to a mistake that anyone can do, including an adult, I know that is wrong
Besides toxic parenting extends beyond beatings, usage of insulting words too much also affects one negatively... 

P.S: a child above 15 shouldn't be touched again, according to my opinion, because they'll obviously do that same wrong and say "shebi its just cane that they'll use to flog me"!
4/24/22, 8:44 PM - +229 67 27 27 67: I know myself. I hate being scolded and I'll rather have you shout at me OR speak to me calmly than being treated like an animal.
4/24/22, 8:45 PM - +229 67 27 27 67: Totally agree with this
4/24/22, 8:46 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Jesus is Lord why couldn’t the save him?😭

Yes, we support ASUU's demand and every student should. Or are you happy that your University doesn't have some necessary facilities? 🙄

What causes strike is the fact that FG is not ready to grant these demands.

Perhaps, you can consider reaching out to the Student Union offices/heads of other victim universities so we can all come together and act as a group in our common interests, in our different locations and using the legally safe means possible.

*YOUR PVC, YOUR VOICE*

As voters' registration winds off in few days time, the Union hereby admonish all Unilorites who have attained the voting age and are yet to get their Permanent Voters' Card to get it done before the deadline.

It is worthy to note that your PVC is your voice to elect credible and visionary leaders during elections.

As stated by INEC, the online pre-registration will be suspended on the 30th May, 2022 while the physical registration at designated centres will end by 30th June, 2022.

The Continuous Voters' Registration (CVR) online platform is enabled to capture your data after which you are scheduled for biometric capture at an INEC office or designated centre close to you.

Follow the steps below for the registration:

◉ Visit - cvr.inecnigeria.org for pre-registration.
◉ Create an account with a valid email address.
◉ Follow the account activation link sent to your email address.
◉ Login and fill the form.
◉ Select a convenient date for your biometric capturing.
◉ Submit form and wait for application slip containing ID, QR Code and other details.
◉ Print out the application slip.
◉ Visit your INEC registration centre to capture your biometric on the appointed date.
◉ A registration slip will be issued once registration is completed.
◉ Use the issued slip to collect your Permanent Voters' Card (PVC)

*REPORTED CASES OF POLICE HARASSMENT IN ILORIN*

The leadership of the Union is not unaware of the reported cases of brutality and harassment on members of our Union by some members of the Kwara State Police Command and drastic actions are currently being taken to ensure justice is served.

After several reports and complaints, the Commissioner of Police has hereby directed that some of the erring officers be redeployed while investigations continue to ensure appropriate sanctions are taken against them.

Also, we have been scheduled for a meeting with the leadership of the command in the early hours of tomorrow, Tuesday May 31, 2022 to further discuss ways to bring end to the incessant harassment.

Ultimately, we urge our colleagues in Ilorin to remain law abiding and not hesitate to report any case of harassment, extortion, intimidation or brutality to the Union or the command. Be assured of our unalloyed commitment to remain people focused and steadfast in the struggle to attain justice.

*RESOLUTION OF THE MEETING WITH THE COMMISSIONER FOR POLICE, KWARA STATE COMMAND*

Earlier today, a delegation of Union officials ably led by the President, Taofik Waliu Opeyemi (OMOLUABI) met with the Commissioner of Police, Kwara State Command to discuss ways to curb the incessant police harassment and extortion.

At the meeting which also featured PPRO of Kwara State Command, DPO F' Division, Union officials and other Union members, the Union confessed its displeasure towards the actions of some of the officers harassing and extorting its members.

The Commissioner however reaffirmed his promise to put end to the menace. He also stressed that the command has began to place appropriate sanctions on erring officers.

The following are the resolutions of the meeting:

- The Command will ensure the safety of lives and properties which is its primary objective;
- Students arrested for cybercrime (or other crimes) should be allowed to communicate with people;
- Police officers should not raid students' hostel unless it is permitted by the DPO of F division and such officer must identify himself and the reasons for engaging such student;
- Any student that is able to identify himself as a student should not be arrested unless there is an huge evidence of an offence committed by him;
- Students should obey the rule of law that banned the movement of motorcycles from working beyond 9pm;
- Students should report cases of brutality to the Union.

Also, it was agreed that a seven man committee of the Student Union will be meeting the Commsioner of Police every fortnight (two weeks) to give comprehensive reports of situations of police brutality from the Tanke area. Thus, all issues of harassment should be reported to the Union officials and if there is any harassment by any police officer, the name of the officer as written on his uniform should be noted and sent to the president and any member of the committee that will soon be constituted for such purpose.

We urge every Unilorites to be law-abiding as we remain steadfast in our commitment to be people focused.

*Aina:* Business Summit is an event that will help to bring students and other young adults to the knowledge about start up and development of business idea of their choice, unleashing their potentials, creating enabling environment for business survival, improve and increase the level of financial independence, and help elevating poverty in country at large. 

*People:* why do I need it now?

*Aina:* Looking at the current happenings and the stand of our Government with the demand of Academic staff union of university (ASUU) has shown that students would not be opportune to access their academic activities for the main time. As concern student, I am aware of the peculiarity of time and opportunity, as the popular saying: nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity. I  am proud to organize a *Virtual Business Summit* to help my fellow students not only Unilorites but also as many students we can reach to maximize this period. We believe the summit will offer a new platform for growth.

*People:*  ooook. Is it going to be on WhatsApp? 

*Aina:* *No* it's on *Twitter* we will be using Twitter Space for the summit in order to accommodate larger audience.  

*People:* *Wow* I will love to be there.

*Aina:* that's Don't Miss out, it's this *June* stay tune for more information.

You parents have invested in places where there wasn't return at some point in time, they survived.

*ROBBERY ATTACKS ON STUDENTS IN TANKE*

We have received the disturbing reports of incessant robbery and violent attacks on our colleagues in Oko Oba and Oke Odo axis of Tanke. The perpetrators have successfully carried out their operations owing to the inadequate security apparatus in these areas. The increasing rate of these incidents is highly condemnable and totally unacceptable.

Proactively, the administration has made efforts to work with the security operatives and hostel owners via series of engagements to ensure security is beefed up in all student areas to secure lives and properties of our colleagues. However, it seems efforts are failing as we now record stories of attack on each day. 

Consequently, we are charging the Kwara State Government, Kwara State Police Command, Tanke association of hostel owners and other stakeholders to take proactive and necessary steps in averting future attacks and make Tanke a safe place for us - Unilorites. This should however be done with impelling alacrity as we are running out of patience as a Union.

Nevertheless, we encourage our colleagues in the affected areas to remain calm and be security-conscious. Information regarding any strange movements or happenings should be reported to the Union and security operatives as soon as possible.

We pacify all victims of attacks and pray that almighty God grant them speedy recoveries. Accept the assurance of our commitment to remain people focused in the struggle to attain justice.

KADUNA NZEOGWU BUILDING
UNIVERSITY OF ILORIN
_2020/2021 ACADEMIC SESSION_

*PRESS RELEASE*

25/06/2022
09:36pm

*INSECURITY: UNION OFFICIALS ENGAGE COMMUNITY HEADS, LANDLORDS AND HOSTEL OWNERS*

Earlier today, a team of Union officials met with the Community leaders and hostel owners both in Oke Odo and Oko Oba axis of Tanke. 

At the meeting with Magaji, landlord association and hostel owners of Oko Oba, it was concluded that a team of vigilante will commence night patrols as an alternative security measure.

The meeting with Magaji of Oke Odo which was held at the Jalala Primary school also had representatives of Hostel owners of the community in attendance. The following resolutions are made during the meeting:

1. The community will organize an awareness to sensitize members on insecurity and safety measures.

2. Students staying in hostel with few occupants are advised to temporarily move in with their friends in hostels with more population pending end of the strike.

3. Students should desist from raising false alarm or creating tension through unnecessary noise and arguments.

4. Students should abstain from late night movement. Okada riders are not allowed to move beyond 9pm as stipulated by the state government.

5. Subsequently, representatives of the Union will attend the community meetings.

Implementation of these resolutions are to follow immediately. Conclusively, we advise Unilorites to stay safe, be security-conscious and report any issue to the Union and Police.

*INSECURITY: POLICE TO COMMENCE NIGHT PATROLS IN TANKE*

Sequel to the recent robbery cases in some areas in Oke-odo, the leadership of the Student Union met the Commissioner of Police today to make few requests in a bid to end these insecurity cases.

The Commissioner of Police, Kwara State Police Command has directed that night patrol of police officers be held continuously across Tipper garage to Oke Odo axis.

This is to ensure safety of lives and properties of occupants in the affected communities.

We want to implore our dearest colleagues to cooperate with the security agents in a bid to end the various social vices in Tanke Community.

*MOHAMMED AYODELE EMERGES KWARA CPN STATE CHAIRMAN*

This is to express our heartiest and kind congratulations to Mohammed Ayodele Ataba, a 300-level student of the department of Arts Education, Faculty of Education on his emergence as the Chairman, Child Protections Network, Kwara State. The organization which exists in the 36 states of the Federation is responsible to carry out monitoring, documentation and reporting of child rights abuse cases as well as advocating for the freedom of every child.

Mr. Mohammed was elected unopposed last week Friday at the association's general election. He is expected to steer the affairs of the organization for three consecutive years.

His victory is well-deserving and we urge him to remain steadfast and better-by-far in discharging the duties entrusted to him.

Replenish my strengths, spend time with my loved ones if possible and get ready for the new week. Can't afford productivity levels to go down you know? 
Plus a digital detox won't kill. I need to keep my sanity. Y'all need to try it out. A couple of days away from your phones and internet. At least for the weekend.

Guys are you really that scared? 🥺🥺🥺... Well it's normal. I'm literally terrified, thinking about resuming school even though I don't have any exams to face upon resumption.


 But at the same time it's the not time to lament over the fact that you have forgotten so many stuff. You're not totally to blame. 

Perhaps I'd suggest you start your revisions now. Spend the necessary hours needed to cover all the materials possible, before the resumption date is announced and the exam date gets set, to at least reduce the chances of any unwanted eventualities.


May God help you all and his wisdom revive your brains and minds.

Good luck with your revisions and your exams too 😇✌🏽✌🏽✌🏽

1. 17 - 24 October, 2022, clearing of the environment preparation for students resumption

2. 24/10/2022, Resumption of Final year and PG students.

3. 7 - 11 November 2022, Faculty Board meeting to consider Graduating students and Good Standing Results.

4. 14- 16 November 2022, BCOS meeting

5. 23/11/2022, Senate meeting to consider Final year results and Good Standing.

10/21/22, 12:12 PM - Abdulrahman Rep: UNILORIN Final Year, PG students resume Oct. 24
*Others resume Dec 15

Following the suspension of the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities  (ASUU), the University of Ilorin has concluded arrangements for the resumption of academic activities  on Monday, October 24, 2022.

This follows the ratification of the  amended Academic Calendar  by the University Senate at its 291st meeting on Friday, October 21, 2022.

According to the amended Calendar, Final Year and Postgraduate students are expected back on campus on Monday, 24th October, 2022, while other categories of returning students will resume on December 15th when the 2021/2022 academic session commences.

Also, students of the Faculties of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, who are yet to complete their Rain Semestre examinations before the commencement of the strike on February 14, 2022, are expected to resume on October 24th to conclude such examinations.

10/21/22, 5:21 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Me 🌚
10/21/22, 5:21 PM - Kingsley: It is waste of time to you when you see it that way really
Them setting a whole month aside to do all that remained from last session
They have exams to mark, results to collate, thousand of students to grant passage out of school, new students to welcome, exams that aren’t finished, then these people should take you in and start classes for you still…
Lol..
10/21/22, 5:22 PM - Tosin: The new students them dey inside the 1month?
10/21/22, 5:22 PM - Tosin: Make I check that thing again
10/21/22, 5:22 PM - Kingsley: Really?
Assuming there was no strike, isn’t this the same thing they do when we finish exams? They stay extra month to mark and do all of these things, plan convocation and new students
10/21/22, 5:22 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Lmao. All most of those works are for the senate who teach post graduate people
10/21/22, 5:23 PM - +234 909 008 3470: So it isn't making sense
10/21/22, 5:23 PM - +234 909 008 3470: I even put all and most on the same statement 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
10/21/22, 5:24 PM - Kingsley: Okay
Imagine if they bring all of us in, they will teach new classes, be marking exams, focus on making sure results collation goes well, plan convocation, all of these things are not simple, even secondary schools make plans, we’ve been on strike, fine, we are tired fine, we want to go over what we need to go over ASAP, fine, understandable, but I wouldn’t let my emotions cloud my judgement here.
10/21/22, 5:25 PM - +234 812 345 4776: I was pissed at the December 1st rumors but this is worse istg
10/21/22, 5:25 PM - Lolu: Exactly!
10/21/22, 5:25 PM - Abu: 100lvl self gats sabi if e cross
10/21/22, 5:25 PM - Lolu: There's legit no proper excuse tbh, man's probably just tryna settle in first and consequently, keeping us on hold
10/21/22, 5:25 PM - Kingsley: This as always being in place before we got there
Nothing we can do will change, I am also pissed, but my anger can’t do nothing
10/21/22, 5:25 PM - Abu: This message was deleted
10/21/22, 5:25 PM - Abu: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Kingsley: Those things are the tidy things they must clear off the desk
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Lolu: I'm not with you on this bruh
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Abu: Aswr ba
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Abu: Even the bush and the lecturers that left
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Kingsley: 100 sef never cross, you want make them bring another 100 level
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Boss, the only excuse normal lectures have is marking scripts and they were idle for 8 months. All these passage isn't a normal lecturers business
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Abu: Everything everything
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Lolu: Werey
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Abu: They were out of service 
If they mark it means they’re still working
10/21/22, 5:26 PM - Kingsley: Naa
I’m not asking for support, we are agreeing to disagree here and vice versa
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Ik that but just because senate has work to do, doesn't mean other lecturers can't work
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - Kingsley: Did they mark it in those eight months?
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - Lolu: Yeah but they want to get paid for doing nothing?
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - Kenny: Whoever wins this argument,  all of us are still resuming Dec 15. It's not within our control
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - Abu: Yh that’s the point of a strike
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - Kenny: 🤧🚶
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - +234 812 345 4776: There was a plan in place before the strike and the slated time for resumption wouldn’t take two months to these things
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - Kingsley: Who are the senate? Outsiders?
Are they not the deans, sub deans and HoDs?
10/21/22, 5:27 PM - +234 909 008 3470: They cleared us after the brought in new 100lvl
10/21/22, 5:28 PM - Kingsley: These participate in results collation as well? They don’t mark?
10/21/22, 5:28 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Lmao. Shey asuu chairman put camera for their room?
10/21/22, 5:28 PM - Abu: 😂😂 ahah
10/21/22, 5:29 PM - Kingsley: Exactly 
That’s my point
It is not even an argument, we are just trying to make each other see reasons and settle our minds instead of working yourself up on what you have no control over
10/21/22, 5:29 PM - +234 909 008 3470: They teach post graduates whi happen to be resuming on Monday so your excuse isn't valid
10/21/22, 5:29 PM - Kingsley: Don’t make a joke out of it, the university is short of work force already, they have things to put in place…running a university is not child’s play bro
10/21/22, 5:30 PM - Kingsley: Was it an easy time for the incoming 100s?
Was it an easy time for you as well?
10/21/22, 5:30 PM - Kingsley: Okay compare the population of the post graduates to the entire undergraduates and see the loopholes
10/21/22, 5:30 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Yh but not being efficient is costly too
10/21/22, 5:30 PM - Kingsley: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 5:31 PM - Kingsley: Efficient by choking everyone up because they think we deserve early resumption?
10/21/22, 5:31 PM - +234 909 008 3470: 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
I don't think you get me
10/21/22, 5:31 PM - Lolu: Lmaoo, in a working system, you don't get paid while you strike
10/21/22, 5:31 PM - Lolu: 😂😂😭
10/21/22, 5:31 PM - Lolu: Me I'm just very disgusted, it's irritating
10/21/22, 5:31 PM - +234 812 345 4776: They will still choke us when we resume in December lol

10/21/22, 5:32 PM - Kingsley: I have in a school system before, a secondary school, as a volunteer, and assistant instructor and one of the desperate times is we are marking and collating results bro…lol
10/21/22, 5:32 PM - Kenny: Same, but what can we do? Nothing 😪
10/21/22, 5:32 PM - Abu: Sha bring food whenever
10/21/22, 5:32 PM - +234 812 363 2882: People just like talking about problems, talking is very inefficient, don't waste your time
10/21/22, 5:32 PM - Kingsley: Na
Explain please
10/21/22, 5:32 PM - Kingsley: Forgotten we are in Nigeria?
10/21/22, 5:32 PM - +234 812 345 4776: These people will take salary for the times they spent at home but they can’t work under pressure???
10/21/22, 5:33 PM - +234 812 345 4776: I no wan hear anything. This new VC dey do honeymoon
10/21/22, 5:33 PM - +234 812 363 2882: No don't explain, we will all conform to the system like NPCs
10/21/22, 5:33 PM - Kingsley: Irritating, but they doing are not doing it to poke us intentionally, before they consider our emotions and stands, they have a school to run
10/21/22, 5:33 PM - Kingsley: Still, it is better than resuming in a chokehold
10/21/22, 5:33 PM - +234 812 363 2882: They are supposed to
10/21/22, 5:33 PM - Kenny: Exactly
10/21/22, 5:34 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Why is everyone using big words here?😭
I thought we had collectively decided to rent bus to go and see wizkid?😭
10/21/22, 5:34 PM - Kingsley: Have you even considered accommodation? Imagine another 100 level comes, how will they harbour all of us, some has to go for there to be space
10/21/22, 5:34 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Wizkid wey flop
10/21/22, 5:34 PM - Aisha: You sef dey see am 😭
10/21/22, 5:34 PM - Lolu: That's the annoying thing
10/21/22, 5:34 PM - +234 816 443 2552: What’s all this "the senate should and shouldn’t have"?😭
10/21/22, 5:34 PM - +234 909 008 3470: I'm saying, the guys that need time to collate results are post graduate lecturers. But the guys that aren't really collating or deciding results will just mark and then go back to their idle selves. I don't think marking takes more than 2 weeks cos I've marked loads of scripts before
10/21/22, 5:35 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Idk if you get
10/21/22, 5:35 PM - Aisha: I just dey come here dey see intellectuals speaking 😭
10/21/22, 5:35 PM - Kingsley: It is easy for you, because you can study under pressure, have you consider the new intakes that will not find it easy because they are new to it…?
10/21/22, 5:35 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Sir it’s about the experience 😂
10/21/22, 5:35 PM - +234 812 363 2882: All these problems have been compounded over the years
10/21/22, 5:35 PM - +234 812 345 4776: They got their demands met to some certain extent but won’t cater to our needs
10/21/22, 5:35 PM - Lolu: They were fighting for salary, they got it and still can't resume immediately
10/21/22, 5:35 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Omooo
I coke dey float think say na only me😭
10/21/22, 5:36 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Same thing the interviewer said
10/21/22, 5:36 PM - Kingsley: Lol, I just said, I don’t feel comfortable with it too, i will take the NpC dish, but what is a PC doing with all talks in the corners of their room?
10/21/22, 5:36 PM - Abdulmalik: Other schools are resuming the previous session and we're also doing the same bruh
10/21/22, 5:36 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Me that was checking outfit just few minutes ago thinking everyone was with me💀
10/21/22, 5:36 PM - Kingsley: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 5:36 PM - +234 812 345 4776: I can’t study any pressure dfkm. My grades are looking spooky and at this point. I just want to continue schooling and get out of here. Funny enough, they will still rush us and the new 100 level set like mad when we enter
10/21/22, 5:37 PM - +234 812 345 4776: So why delay??
10/21/22, 5:37 PM - +234 812 363 2882: I no read all the messages, I am lazy so I just came in mid argument with no information on what is happen...
10/21/22, 5:37 PM - +234 816 443 2552: Sha sha let’s discuss our funding for the bus
Sammy you’ll drive us to cut cost
10/21/22, 5:37 PM - Kingsley: Well, the marking can be brushed over, but remember some hasn’t even defended projects?
This thing takes like two weeks in a faculty oo?
10/21/22, 5:37 PM - Lolu: Yeah, let's keep acting like we've not always been ahead of other schools
10/21/22, 5:38 PM - +234 909 008 3470: They are still going to rush us. The an I'd to finish before the summer. 2nd week of Jul probably. The session that is
10/21/22, 5:38 PM - Lolu: Where's the bus picking you people? Be like I go comot this Ilorin
10/21/22, 5:38 PM - Kingsley: Exactly…
Some has to go before some will come
Na park people wan dey sleep?
Off campus go come choke because everyone wan enter school…
10/21/22, 5:38 PM - Abu: Even those that will take school hostels
10/21/22, 5:38 PM - Abu: Plus they never finish bridge
10/21/22, 5:39 PM - Kingsley: Because they’ve didn’t start exams, they have to resume classes not the end of semester…
Think!!!!!!£
10/21/22, 5:39 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Intellectuals do tends to make very little impact, because they simple analyze the situation and hide behind it so they can do nothing
10/21/22, 5:40 PM - Kingsley: They need to delay so that the pressure of rushing will reduce bro, everyone in this system is human too now…
Will you deliver “efficiently” if you are over worked?
10/21/22, 5:40 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Which will be later paid to the hospital because I cannot drive
10/21/22, 5:40 PM - Aisha: Yh most schools are resuming mid session

I know schools resuming January na 😂💔, ABU Zaria
10/21/22, 5:40 PM - +234 909 008 3470: 2 weeks of defence + 1 week of marking, they still have 4 weeks of idleness. I'm referring to undergraduate lecturers
10/21/22, 5:40 PM - Aisha: I don't even understand your words scholar 😭
10/21/22, 5:40 PM - +234 816 443 2552: That depends on how many of us are going and where we’re going from 
Because he’ll do in Lagos and Abuja 
So it’s either we all meet in ilorin and drive to Lagos or there’ll be Lagos grouo and Abuja group
10/21/22, 5:40 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Everyone in Academia is incompetent
10/21/22, 5:40 PM - Kingsley: And we will still run ahead bro, we both know this school
10/21/22, 5:41 PM - Abdulmalik: Are we not saying the same thing?
10/21/22, 5:41 PM - Kingsley: Normal, you wan reach September before?
10/21/22, 5:41 PM - +234 816 443 2552: @2349012088548 will drive then 
You’re conductor
10/21/22, 5:41 PM - Kingsley: All of these problems are what they address, it is wickedness to some people, but it is duty to them.
10/21/22, 5:42 PM - Kingsley: Off campus
God abeg
10/21/22, 5:42 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Think of scientist saying I have been doing research for years and can hide behind "doing research" without doing anything practical
10/21/22, 5:42 PM - Kingsley: Ehn ehn now
I have a friend there too
Hurt but still, we just gaz chill.
10/21/22, 5:42 PM - +234 909 008 3470: So na rush them wan rush us. I hope you know the Dec 15th is for registration, classes will most likely start next year. It actually depends on your faculty sha
10/21/22, 5:43 PM - +234 812 363 2882: wow, see disrespect 😂
10/21/22, 5:43 PM - Kingsley: Not all of these undergraduate lectures are idle naaaa
Collation of results starts from department level straight up to senate…
Who will do it at department level? The senate?
10/21/22, 5:43 PM - Aisha: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 5:44 PM - Kingsley: Una go pass Ibadan yeah?

Now I have headache 😭😭
10/21/22, 5:45 PM - +234 909 008 3470: As you're marking, you record na. It's the big boys that do the heavy lifting. They are the ones that decide who crosses or not, who convocates or not
10/21/22, 5:45 PM - Kingsley: Returning students will start classes 
That one is sure
10/21/22, 5:45 PM - Aisha: How e no affect? 🌚
10/21/22, 5:45 PM - Lolu: That's right

10/21/22, 5:45 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Lmao. My uncle said it's registration. Remind we have to register courses after they've debated our results
10/21/22, 5:46 PM - Kingsley: Lol, do you know the number of students coming from those ends? The traffic wahala that that one will cause nko?
Broo now, don’t allow the emotions block the logic
10/21/22, 5:46 PM - +234 909 008 3470: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 5:46 PM - +234 812 345 4776: So if they don’t finish bridge till end of next year. We no go resume? 😂
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - Kingsley: Okay what me I know is, sitting is from department level. All of them will sit and pity who they want to pity and pity who they don’t want to pity…
What about that?
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - +234 909 008 3470: If they never finish bridge by December, won't we still come?
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - Lolu: It's the bus you're going with I want to follow
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Leave am 🤣🤣🤣🤣
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - +234 812 345 4776: You as student can consider that bridge but school no dey consider am istg
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - Kingsley: It is stressful to make a change when we don’t agree
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - +234 812 363 2882: You'd probably send your children abroad and never have to argue about ASUU ever
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - Lolu: Una no even like yourselves 🤣🤣
10/21/22, 5:47 PM - Kingsley: No online be that one?

10/21/22, 5:49 PM - Lolu: Wale it's the truth, that one is a problem we have to deal with as students, not the university itself
10/21/22, 5:49 PM - +234 909 008 3470: It's them Dean and Hofs our lecturers might not be at such meetings
10/21/22, 5:49 PM - Kingsley: Another angle
A conflicting world would be nice
10/21/22, 5:49 PM - Lolu: Rest Wale, no one is arguing that.
10/21/22, 5:50 PM - +234 909 008 3470: I don tell you my own. If you like dey argue
10/21/22, 5:50 PM - Kingsley: The university needs to cut off the number of students presence in school and school area.
10/21/22, 5:50 PM - Abu: Road na

10/21/22, 5:57 PM - Kingsley: VC is not a military government sha
The school is being run by a group of individuals not one
10/21/22, 5:57 PM - Kingsley: I love this

10/21/22, 5:57 PM - +234 812 363 2882: So if you're not sure of their payment status then why assume they are capable of resuming?
10/21/22, 5:57 PM - +234 812 363 2882: I no dey argue that thing again
10/21/22, 5:57 PM - +234 812 363 2882: But he's better 😂😂
10/21/22, 5:58 PM - +234 909 008 3470: Cos they have been told to resume and they have an agreement in place
10/21/22, 5:58 PM - +234 909 008 3470: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 5:58 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Then tell him, or find a way to make that possible
10/21/22, 5:58 PM - Abdulmalik: Have they covered the lost ground?
10/21/22, 5:59 PM - Abdulmalik: Abi o
10/21/22, 5:59 PM - Lolu: Board of advisors, not decision takers.
Bulk of the decision taking is still in his hands wys?
10/21/22, 5:59 PM - Lolu: You think they intend to?
10/21/22, 5:59 PM - +234 909 008 3470: The main problem about payment, isn't really about owing salaries just so you know
10/21/22, 5:59 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Has the government fulfilled their side of the agreement?
10/21/22, 6:00 PM - +234 909 008 3470: I don't think decisions are made without his approval. But what do ik
10/21/22, 6:00 PM - +234 909 008 3470: <Media omitted>

They don’t just mark results
10/21/22, 6:01 PM - Lolu: Lol
10/21/22, 6:01 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Exactly the point, with all these uncertainties...
10/21/22, 6:01 PM - Lolu: Sammy rest
10/21/22, 6:01 PM - Abdulmalik: That's probably the only reason why no-work no-pay was suspended
10/21/22, 6:01 PM - +234 812 363 2882: Sorry sir
10/21/22, 6:02 PM - Lolu: They do not mark results

10/21/22, 6:03 PM - Lolu: That was why I wanted the no-work no-pay thingy
10/21/22, 6:03 PM - Lolu: If it was fully implemented, they'd think twice before going on strike the next time
10/21/22, 6:03 PM - Kingsley: Correction taken my Lord scholar
10/21/22, 6:04 PM - Kingsley: This is not about the strike
This is another thing entirely
